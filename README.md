# Jeskai Tokens

I've been playing Jeskai Tokens online in leagues to moderate success. Smashing people with a pile of extremely large tokens is satisfying, especially when you deal 15+ damage in a single turn. The decklist.txt file contains the actual list, but here's a quick discussion of card choices. 

## Token makers

>4 Dragon Fodder    
>4 Hordeling Outburst    
>2 Secure the Wastes    

The two sorcery-speed Goblin-makers are most efficient, and that efficiency trumps the instant-speed option. You need tokens, and you need them to be attacking sooner rather than later. Secure is better later in the game, but a 3-mana Raise the Alarm is also workable if it's what you have in hand.

## Removal / Burn Spells

>2 Wild Slash    
>2 Fiery Impulse    
>2 Valorous Stance    
>2 Crackling Doom    
>1 Jeskai Charm    

The main has a flexible assortment of instants to remove things that are troublesome. Fiery Impulse almost always hits for 3 in this deck, and if it doesn't, you can loot another instant/sorcery to the yard to make it get there. Wild Slash, meanwhile, goes to the face, which is important in a burn-out situation or when the opponent doesn't have any creatures on board. Crackling Doom is a concession to decks playing big dragons, while Valorous Stance removes problems in Abzan Aggro / green decks without being embarassing in other matchups. Sometimes the protection mode is even relevant!

## Creatures and Planeswalkers

>2 Seeker of the Way    
>2 Abbot of Keral Keep    
>1 Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh    
>1 Gideon, Ally of Zendikar    
>1 Sorin, Solemn Visitor    

The creatures all synergize with spells, and Gideon and Sorin are both excellent. An extra Glorious Anthem goes really well with a pile of tokens, and Sorin's +1 is a *huge* swing in any race. For the Prowess dudes, Seeker gains life and hits early, while Abbot draws an extra card. Chandra is the swingiest card of the bunch, and I'll be testing a third Abbot in her place. With Jeskai Ascendancy out (or even with the large number of cheap red spells) she can do a lot of damage-- anywhere from 5 to 7 in a single turn, leaving behind a planeswalker. If she just gets killed, though? Disappointment.

I've also tried Monastery Mentor before. It's *okay*.

I've tested Jace, Vryn's Prodigy in the deck, and I didn't like him. Everything in the deck (aside from the Ascendancies and card draw spells) can beat down, and he can't beat down. Treasure Cruise + Ascendancy is already a lot of card advantage.
